### Brewing

- [ ] Heat 2qt water to 160° in POT 1
- [ ] Add grain to POT 1 and mix to consistency of oatmeal and add water if too dry or hot (MASHING IN)
- [ ] Cook for 60 minutes, keep between 144° and 152° (don't need to heat constantly) taking temperature from multiple locations in pot; stir every 10 minutes
- [ ] Heat POT 1 to 170° while stirring constantly (MASHING OUT)
- [ ] Heat 4qt water to 170° in POT 2
- [ ] Put strainer over POT 3 (currently empty)
- [ ] Pour mash from POT 1 into strainer over POT 3
- [ ] Pour water from POT 2 into strainer over POT 3
- [ ] Move strainer with mash over POT 2, pour liquid from POT 3 through strainer into POT 1
- [ ] Remove strainer from POT 2
- [ ] Discard mash from strainer
- [ ] Heat POT 2 to light boil until "hot break" is hit (begins to foam) and make sure it doesn’t boil over
- [ ] Pour hops into a small bowl so splitting it up later will be easier
- [ ] Lightly boil for 60 minutes, stirring occasionally. During boil:
- [ ]   - AT START OF BOIL: add 1/3 of the hopsh

- [ ] Add entire packet of yeast (PITCH)
- [ ] Sanitize hands, place hand over opening in glass job, and shake aggressively (will wakeup yeast and further aerate the wort)
- [ ] Add screw top stopper to jug
- [ ] Insert rubber tube no more than 1 inch into the stopper, and put other end of tube into a bowl of sanitizer (BLOW OFF TUBE)
- [ ] Let sit for 2 - 3 days, or until vigorous bubbling subsides (this is when fermentation is highest)
